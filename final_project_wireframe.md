# Final Project, Part II: Sketches, Wireframes, Storyboards
## Storyboards


## User research protocol
### Target audience
The target audience for this final project will be anyone who has heard of or even experienced terrorist attacks but was not exposed to relevant statistics of terrorism. For most people, 911 is the one that happened in their life, but there are much more terrorist activities happening around the globe, and this presentation aims to bring attention to these activities.

### Approach to identifying representative individuals to interview  
To select people to interview and critique my wireframes, I was thinking of people from different ethnicity and/or countries. I reached out to three peers in my master program (one Chinese, one Turkish and one Indian) and two undergraduate from a data science class (both White).

### Interview script  
Since this project's goal is to raise people's awareness of terrorism by showcasing relevant data, my interview questions focused on: people's impression of terrorism before and after they examine my wireframes.
#### General knowledge
- What are your first impression when you hear about the term "terrorism"?
- Do you you know any numbers or figures about terrorism?  

#### Overall impression of wireframe
- Can you describe what the story is telling you?
- Is there anything that you find surprising or confusing?

#### Intro
- Which stock image do you prefer to see at the very beginning of the story and why?
- Is there anything that you think is missing from the intro?

#### statistics
- What data do you expect to see that reflects how widespread terrorism is?

#### Graph and visual
- Do you think the current graphs are understandable to you? If not, what kind of graphs do you prefer?

### Findings from your interviews
**Trend in 2014:**
People are interested in what happened in 2014, causing an uplift in number of terrorist attacks.  
Look into social and economical factors that contribute to this phenomenon.  

**What else do you like to see in the narrative?**  
"The Islamic State uses social media to promote its beliefs and attract newcomers, especially younger generation. How did they do this? I would like to know more data about that."  
How social media help spread terrorism?

"People know about terrorism by their names and locations, but they feel like it's quite far from their lives. Maybe you can find some data to show like there's one terrorist in every 100 or so people."  
Showcase how terrorism is close to the public.
