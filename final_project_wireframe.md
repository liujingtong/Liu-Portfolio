# Final Project, Part II: Sketches, Wireframes, Storyboards
## Wireframes


## User research protocol
1. The target audience you hope to reach with your story  
The target audience for this final project will be anyone who has heard of or even experienced terrorist attacks but was not exposed to relevant statistics of terrorism. For most people, 911 is the one that happened in their life, but there are much more terrorist activities happening around the globe, and this presentation aims to bring attention to these activities.

2. your approach to identifying representative individuals to interview  
To select people to interview and critique my wireframes, I was thinking of people from different ethnicity and/or countries. I reached out to three peers in my master program (one Chinese, one Turkish and one Indian) and two undergraduate from a data science class (both White).

3. your interview script  
Since this project's goal is to raise people's awareness of terrorism by showcasing relevant data, my interview questions focused on: people's impression of terrorism before and after they examine my wireframes.
- What are your first impression when you hear about the term "terrorism"?
- Do you you know any numbers or figures about terrorism?
