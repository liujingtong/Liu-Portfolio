Portfolio for 2019 Fall 94870 Telling Stories with Data

# ABOUT ME
HELLO! I am Jingtong Liu, a master student in Integrated Innovation for Products and Services. You can also call me Troy. I go by the pronoun he/him/his. 

People in my major come from different background, mostly design, engineering or business, and learn to collaborate with interdicplinary thinkers and doers and drive innovation. 

# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn the basic techniques to create easy-to-understand data visualizations that can tell compelling stories. Also, I would love to build up quantitative research skills and complement my qualitative research background as a UX researcher.
