# Critique by Design
In this assignment, I was asked to choose a data visualization, do a critique on it and make some redesign around it. The visualization I found is this, a chart showing the rate of abortions and that of prevention services from 2006 to 2013 at Planned Parenthood, a nonprofit organization that provides reproductive health care in the United States. [Here](https://thefederalist.com/2015/09/30/at-planned-parenthood-abortion-is-up-health-care-is-down/) is the link to the original chart.
